3/4 initial commit

3/5 

ISSUES:
Regularizations causing instability in nmf

SMALL TO DOs:
S4 "show" function for objects of class "nmfmodel"
S4 method for nmfmodel to wrap c_loss_sample data into an nmfmodel
S4 plot method for "nmfmodel" class that wraps mheatmap
Wrap detailed nmf/nnls parameters into S4 "nmfParams" and "nnlsParams" objects

LARGER TO DOs:
SNAIL NNLS for better L0 approximation
